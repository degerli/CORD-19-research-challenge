In \"Taking the naturalness out of natural disasters\", the authors claimed that the socio-**economic** condition was the **cause** of natural disasters. Natural disasters do not equally affect all people. Instead, the **impact** of the disaster is contingent on the vulnerability of the affected people, which often differs systematically across **economic** class, ethnicity, gender, and other factors [6] . In fact, a vulnerability approach to disasters would suggest that inequalities in exposure and sensitivity to risk as well as inequalities in access to opportunities systematically disadvantage certain groups of people, rendering them more vulnerable to the **impact** of natural disasters [7] ."

Second is the behavioral effect due to people's fear of contagion. Such behavioral effects **cause** a decrease in labor force participation due to the fear of contact with other people, shutting down places of employment.

In addition, during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the largest **economic** effects of the crisis was not the direct effect (**mortality**, **morbidity**, caregiving and the associated **losses** to working days), but the decrease in the goods and services demand by behavioral effects (changes in behavior) due to fear, reducing domestic income and employment.

       "The recent MERS outbreak in Korea, which spread rapidly due to slow and unreliable diagnosis, resulted in a 41% reduction in foreign tourism and decreased the gross domestic product growth **rate** in 2015 by 0.1% (18) . The MRPrimerV database contains 152 380 247 high-quality PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses, covering 100% of the RNA viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database (Release 76). Because all primers in MRPrimerV were subjected to the same stringent filtering constraints and rigorous similarity testing against all 101 684 human gene sequences, 26 720 camel sequences and all RNA virus sequences, they are all highly target-specific for RNA viruses. The current MRPrimerV database mainly provides primers for detection of RNA viruses that infect human hosts. However, since many human pathogens, such as Zika, JEV, WNV, DENV, MERS-CoV and influenza virus, can also infect other animal species, future work will be directed toward updating the database to include primers against other animal species. MRPrimerV is freely accessible and provides a user-friendly interface. Because the database ranks the CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer pairs, users can easily select primers for multi-phase PCR experiments to achieve more accu**rate** detection of viruses. MR-PrimerV also supports multi-virus detection and TaqMan probes. MRPrimerV contains not only primers, but also validation results for some viruses, and users are invited to send their own experimental validation data for MRPrimerV primers, so that they can be shared by researchers and international health communities. In addition, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering a total of 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. Therefore, this database could be used in viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating viral variability, as well as other scientific tasks. In the future, we will add a feature that allows users to design primers using virus sequences they provide. We believe that MRPrimerV, as a public database of high-quality primers for RNA virus detection, will aid future efforts to design primers for reliable diagnoses, facilitating effective responses to potential epidemics."

The transitions of the infected individuals from symptom onset to hospitalization and then to case confirmation were assumed to follow the distributions inferred from the case report data (see Supplementary Materials for detail). Simulation of the model using best fit parameters showed that the model described the observed case counts over time well (Fig. 2E) .

Due to the closure of Wuhan (and other cities in Hubei), the number of cases reported in other provinces during this period shall start to track local infection dynamics rather than imports from Wuhan. We estimated that the exponential growth **rate** is decreased to 0.14 per day (CI: 0.12 to 0.15 per day) since January 30. Based on this growth **rate** and an R0 between 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures, a calculation following the formula in Ref. (14) suggested that a growth **rate** decreasing from 0.29 per day to 0.14 per day translates to a 50%-59% decrease in R0 to between 2.3 to 3.0. This is in agreement with previous estimates of the impact of effective social distancing during 1918 influenza pandemic (18) . Thus, the reduction in growth **rate** may reflect the impact of vigorous control measures implemented and individual behavior changes in China during the course of the outbreak."

Among many factors, the Lunar New Year Travel rush in early and mid-January 2020 may or may not play a role in the high outbreak growth **rate**, although SARS epidemic also overlapped with the Lunar New Year Travel rush. How contiguous the 2019-nCoV is in other countries remains to be seen. If the value of R0 is as high in other countries, our results suggest that active and strong population-wide social distancing efforts, such as closing down transportation system, schools, discouraging travel, etc., might be needed to reduce the overall contacts to contain the spread of the virus. , between hospitalization to discharge (E) and between hospitalization to death (F).
